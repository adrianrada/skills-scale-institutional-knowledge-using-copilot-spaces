# OctoAcme — Cross-Functional Collaboration & Hand-off Guide

## Purpose
This guide clarifies key collaboration points and hand-offs between roles throughout the project lifecycle to improve accountability, reduce delays, and ensure smooth transitions.

## Key Collaboration Patterns

### Product Manager → UX Designer
**When**: During feature definition and design phase
**Hand-off**:
- Problem statement and user needs
- Success metrics and business constraints
- Target users and use cases
**Expected Output**: 
- User flows, wireframes, and prototypes
- Design specifications for developers

---

### UX Designer → Developers
**When**: After design approval, before implementation
**Hand-off**:
- Design specifications and assets
- Interaction patterns and behaviors
- Accessibility requirements
**Expected Output**:
- Implementation that matches design specs
- Feedback on technical constraints or alternative approaches

---

### Product Manager → Developers
**When**: During backlog refinement and sprint planning
**Hand-off**:
- User stories with acceptance criteria
- Priority and business context
- Dependencies and constraints
**Expected Output**:
- Estimates and implementation plan
- Technical approach and clarifying questions

---

### Developers → QA Lead
**When**: Feature development complete, ready for testing
**Hand-off**:
- Completed implementation with passing unit tests
- Test environment setup instructions
- Known limitations or edge cases
**Expected Output**:
- Test results and defect reports
- Quality sign-off or issues to address

---

### QA Lead → DevOps Engineer
**When**: Feature tested and approved, ready for deployment
**Hand-off**:
- QA sign-off and test results
- Smoke test checklist for production
- Known issues or monitoring considerations
**Expected Output**:
- Successful deployment to staging/production
- Post-deployment verification results

---

### Developers + DevOps Engineer → Technical Writer
**When**: Feature implementation complete, approaching release
**Hand-off**:
- Feature description and capabilities
- Configuration options and API changes
- Migration steps or breaking changes
**Expected Output**:
- Updated documentation (user guides, API docs, release notes)
- Documentation ready before or at release time

---

### Project Manager → Stakeholders
**When**: At key milestones and decision gates
**Hand-off**:
- Status updates and progress metrics
- Risks, issues, and mitigation plans
- Requests for decisions or approvals
**Expected Output**:
- Feedback and approvals
- Resource or priority decisions

---

### Stakeholders → Sponsor
**When**: Escalation needed or major decisions required
**Hand-off**:
- Business case for decision
- Impact analysis and options
- Recommendation from project team
**Expected Output**:
- Executive decision and support
- Resource allocation or priority changes

---

### Team → Scrum Master
**When**: Blockers or process impediments arise
**Hand-off**:
- Description of blocker or impediment
- Impact on delivery timeline
- Attempts already made to resolve
**Expected Output**:
- Blocker removed or escalated
- Process improvement suggestions

---

## Hand-off Checklist Template

Use this template for major deliverable hand-offs:

### Hand-off: [From Role] → [To Role]
- **Date**:
- **Deliverable**:
- **Context/Background**:
- **What's included**:
  - [ ] Item 1
  - [ ] Item 2
  - [ ] Item 3
- **What's expected next**:
- **Timeline/Deadline**:
- **Key contacts**:
- **Known issues or caveats**:
- **Sign-off**: [ ] Received and acknowledged

---

## Best Practices for Effective Hand-offs

1. **Document assumptions**: Make implicit knowledge explicit
2. **Include context**: Why this matters, not just what to do
3. **Set clear expectations**: What does "done" look like?
4. **Provide timeline**: When is this needed?
5. **Designate contacts**: Who to ask for clarifications?
6. **Confirm receipt**: Don't assume—get explicit acknowledgment
7. **Follow up**: Check in after hand-off to address questions

---

## Common Hand-off Anti-patterns to Avoid

- ❌ "Over the wall" throw—no context or follow-up
- ❌ Assuming others know what you know
- ❌ No clear ownership or next steps
- ❌ Missing or incomplete artifacts
- ❌ Ambiguous acceptance criteria
- ❌ No timeline or urgency communicated
