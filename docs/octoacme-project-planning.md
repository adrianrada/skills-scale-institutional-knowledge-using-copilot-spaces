# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders, sponsor, and delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria (Product Manager leads with input from UX Designer and QA Lead)
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD) with input from QA Lead and DevOps Engineer
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map (coordinated by Project Manager with DevOps Engineer)
7. Establish team rhythm and ceremonies (facilitated by Scrum Master if applicable)
