# OctoAcme Project Management Processes

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation! This guide serves as your entry point to understanding how we plan, execute, and deliver successful projects.

## Philosophy

At OctoAcme, we believe in an **iterative, evidence-driven approach** to project management that puts customer value at the center of everything we do. Our process is designed to:

- **Deliver regular value** through small, testable increments
- **Manage risk proactively** by identifying and mitigating issues early
- **Drive continuous improvement** through measured outcomes and team retrospectives
- **Maintain transparency** with stakeholders through clear communication and documentation
- **Empower teams** with clear ownership and psychological safety

## Key Principles & Practices

### Clear Ownership
Every project has defined roles with clear responsibilities:
- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, schedules, risks, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success
- **Delivery Team**: Implements features, collaborates on design, and ensures quality
- **Specialized Roles**: Scrum Master, QA Lead, UX Designer, Technical Writer, DevOps Engineer
- **Leadership**: Stakeholders and Sponsors provide strategic guidance and support

See [Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) for detailed role definitions and collaboration points.

### Regular Stakeholder Alignment
- Weekly syncs between PM and Product Lead
- Consistent team standups and sprint reviews
- Monthly stakeholder updates
- Transparent communication of progress, risks, and blockers

### Tracked Risks & Dependencies
- Active risk registers maintained throughout the project lifecycle
- Clear escalation paths for blockers and issues
- Cross-team dependency tracking and management

### Tested Changes & Quality Standards
- Comprehensive testing: unit, integration, and end-to-end
- Code reviews and CI/CD automation
- Clear Definition of Done and acceptance criteria
- Security scanning integrated into the development pipeline

### Actionable Retrospectives
- Regular retrospectives after sprints, releases, and milestones
- Focus on 2-3 prioritized action items per retrospective
- Clear owners and timelines for improvements
- Measured impact to drive continuous learning
